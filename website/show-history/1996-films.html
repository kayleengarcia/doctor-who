      <h1>1996 Films</h1>
      <p><em><strong>Doctor Who</strong></em> is a British-American-Canadian television film continuing the British science fiction television series <em>Doctor Who</em>. Developed as a co-production between BBC Worldwide, Universal Studios, 20th Century Fox and the American network Fox, the 1996 television film premiered on 12 May 1996 on CITV in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada (which was owned by WIC at the time before being acquired by Canwest Global in 2000), 15 days before its first showing in the United Kingdom on BBC. One and two days before being broadcast in the United States on Fox. It was also shown in some countries for a limited time in cinemas.</p>
      <p>The film was the first attempt to revive <em>Doctor Who</em> following its suspension in 1989. It was intended as a back-door pilot for a new American-produced <em>Doctor Who</em> TV series and introduced <a href="../the-doctors/actors/paul-mcgann.html">Paul McGann</a> as the <a href="../the-doctors/characters/the-eighth-doctor.html">Eighth Doctor</a> in his only televised appearance as the character until "The Night of the Doctor" in 2013. It also marks the final appearance of <a href="../the-doctors/actors/sylvester-mccoy.html">Sylvester McCoy</a> as the <a href="../the-doctors/characters/the-seventh-doctor.html">Seventh Doctor</a> and the only appearance of Daphne Ashbrook as companion Grace Holloway. Although a ratings success in the United Kingdom, the film did not fare well on American television and no series was commissioned. The series was later relaunched on the BBC in 2005. The only official<em> Doctor Who</em> episodes between the film and the new series were a 1999 spoof, <em>Doctor Who and the Curse of Fatal Death</em>, and a 2003 animation, <em>Scream of the Shalka</em>.</p>
      <p>Although the film was primarily produced by different people than the 1963–89 series and intended for an American audience, the producers chose not to produce a "re-imagining" or "reboot" of the series but rather a continuation of the original narrative. The production was filmed in Vancouver, British Columbia, to date the only episode of <em>Doctor Who</em> filmed in Canada.    </p>
